# AREA 17 HTML Boilerplate

## Introduction

A framework independent HTML boilerplate with some useful includes such as:

* JavaScript mustard test
* Social network meta info
* AREA 17 site credit link

## JavaScript mustard test

"Cutting the Mustard" was coined by [Tom Maslen](https://github.com/tmaslen) during the development of the responsive BBC website to describe their progressive enhancement methodology.

To see if the user's browser supports modern JavaScript, this boilerplate tests if a browser supports ES6 Modules or not ([CANIUSE](https://caniuse.com/es6-module)). Modern browsers will load the main site JavaScript, whilst older browsers will not - they will instead run `nomodule` script.

You may still need individual tests and/or polyfills for your specific project needs.

### Bug reports and features submission

To submit an issue or request a feature, please do so on [Github](https://github.com/area17/html-boilerplate/issues).

If you file a bug report, your issue should contain a title and a clear description of the issue. You should also include as much relevant information as possible and a code sample that demonstrates the issue. The goal of a bug report is to make it easy for yourself - and others - to replicate the bug and develop a fix.

Remember, bug reports are created in the hope that others with the same problem will be able to collaborate with you on solving it. Do not expect that the bug report will automatically see any activity or that others will jump to fix it. Creating a bug report serves to help yourself and others start on the path of fixing the problem.
